                    <h2> About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a mainly self-taught web developer looking for an Apprentice Role 
                        to develop the skills I have leant so far and to gain experience in an 
                        industry setting. I was a pastry chef for many years but when the covid pandemic hit and I was given a severance package I decided now was the perfect time to change career and do something I would love. I have wanted to make this change for a number of years now but I didn’t believe it was feasible without a degree in the field.  I have been building my own web pages and learning 
                        mostly front-end languages and technologies such as HTML, CSS, 
                        Bootstrap and WordPress. I am also in the early processes of learning 
                        JavaScript, Python and MySQL. I have recently been building custom theme 
                        WordPress sites using PHP. For the best part of the last year I have been building static sites and building up my portfolio using the languages and skills I have learnt so far.  Although I have more experience in 
                        front end development and WordPress my ambition is to become a full 
                        stack developer in the future. I have also completed a coding and 
                        development course with Code nation and a Web Design course with 
                        Adobe XD. I am looking for an opportunity to break in the industry and I 
                        am determined to prove that even without a degree in the field I can 
                        become a successful developer and a valued member of your team.
                         </p>
                         <h3>Experience</h3>
                         <p> I have recently been building a custom WordPress website for a non-profit 
                            organisation to gain experience in a professional setting. I designed the site 
                            using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. I then created a custom theme with 
                            PHP with theme supports and custom post types. The client was very happy 
                            with the results.
                            I learnt a lot and it was a great experience to learn more about PHP, custom 
                            themes and post types. Also, the useful plugins that WordPress has in its 
                            library.
                            I have been building several of my Web Pages over the last 8 months using 
                            HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and WordPress. I have also been developing Shopify 
                            platforms. These Sites are fully responsive and can be used on many different 
                            browsers. I have also used JavaScript, PHP and Python to a lesser extent.
                            I have also designed webpages using Adobe XD and have some Photoshop 
                            experience.
                            I also have experience in making a team Word based game with Python as part 
                            of my Code Nation Coding and Development course in which I also used 
                            systems such as Trello, Slack and Kanban to plan and build the project with my 
                            team mates. I also built my own “About me” Website. I enjoyed my time in the 
                            course, working as a team to produce a project on time and problem-solving 
                            together. I also led the presentation of the game to the rest of the class with a 
                            demonstration of the game and the code used and a power point presentation 
                            of the different stages of planning and problems we faced/solved.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Non Web Experience</h3>
                            <p> I have been a pastry chef for a number of years, having worked in the 
                                Bakery/Catering industry since I left school. I have rose to the level of head 
                                pastry chef in my last two positions and worked as Head Baker at Manchester 
                                University for the past 5 years. Where I believe I developed many transferable 
                                skills such as 
                                <ul>
                                     <li>Team work</li>

                                     <li>An attention to detail</li>

                                </ul>
                                I also won several industry awards as part of TUCO the national university 
                                caterers association. </p>

                                    <p> I am a bit of a foodie and enjoy trying out new restaurants and trying 
                                        new recipes. I am also a strong baker after years of being a pastry chef. I 
                                        enjoy playing badminton, and I jog quite often and have completed a
                                        few half marathons which helps to burn off all the food and cake. I enjoy 
                                        watching football and socializing with friends. I have also taken up 
                                        painting but I’m a long way from being a master at the moment. I also 
                                        enjoy gaming. </p>
